* IEEE FPGA Workshop Part 1: SystemVerilog and Simulation

Use FastX: [[https://fastx.ews.illinois.edu/]]. For help, go to
[[https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois.engineering/page.php?id=81727]].

Open a terminal (right click on the GNOME desktop and click "Open in
terminal"). In the terminal, do:

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/nebhrajani-a/ieee-fpga-workshop
  cd ieee-fpga-workshop/combinational_logic
  module load Synopsys_x86-64/2021 # Adding this to your .bashrc is a good idea
  make run
#+end_src

This should run a simulation and fail at task 0. Open up the file
=hdl/combinational_logic.sv= and start doing the tasks! The testbench
is in =hvl/top_tb.sv=.

To view the waveform, in the shell, do:

#+begin_src sh
  ./run_verdi.sh &
#+end_src
